# Data Structures 2 Course Labs
This repository contains implementations of core data structures and algorithms covered in the Data Structures 2 course. The main projects include:

1. **Sorting Algorithms**
2. **Hashing Techniques**
3. **Shortest Paths Finder**

All projects are implemented in Java, showcasing fundamental concepts and practical applications.

## Overview

### 1. Sorting Algorithms

This project includes various sorting algorithms to sort arrays or lists of elements. The implementation demonstrates both comparison-based and non-comparison-based sorting techniques.

**Algorithms Implemented:**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Radix Sort**

**Features:**
- Sorting of integer arrays and lists.
- Performance comparison through benchmarking.
- Visualization of sorting processes.

### 2. Hashing Techniques
This project focuses on implementing hashing techniques and hash table structures to manage and retrieve data efficiently. It includes different hashing methods and collision resolution strategies.

**Techniques Implemented:**
- **N method**
- **N^2 Method**

**Features:**
- Insert, delete, and search operations.
- Handling of hash collisions.
- Performance analysis of different hashing techniques.

### 3. Shortest Paths Finder
This project implements algorithms to find the shortest paths in weighted graphs. It includes algorithms for both directed and undirected graphs.

**Algorithms Implemented:**
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: For finding the shortest paths from a single source to all other nodes in a graph with non-negative weights.
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: For finding the shortest paths from a single source in a graph that may contain negative weights.
- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: For finding shortest paths between all pairs of nodes.

**Features:**
- Graph representation and adjacency matrix.
- Pathfinding and distance calculations.
- Handling of different types of graphs (directed, undirected).

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / Any preferred Java IDE
